# README Generator

## Description

This is an app that allows the user to generate a README.md file more efficiently by using the command "node index.js" while in the parent file from a command shell. Instead of writing out generic parts of the README file like "# Description", this app will create the basic structure of the file, and allow the user to write the particular parts for each section.

## Installation

Dependencies needed for installation:

### [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
> Install within the specific file using "npm i inquirer"

> Ensure dependency files are not being pushed to Github/etc. For Github, write "node_modules/" within a .gitignore file of the same parent repo. 
## Test Commands

To initialize the app, open a command shell, navigate to the /readme-generator, and type the following:

`` node index.js
``
